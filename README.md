About Me
--------

Writing code fascinates me, and I constantly work to better myself as a programmer. I take great satisfaction from finding solutions to problems of all sizes, and I love to learn. I’m always ready to take on new approaches and to rebuild my code from scratch if there’s a better way.

Employment
----------

### Photocrowd - Developer
**(11/15 - present)**
### [Current Role]

Working in a tight-knit agile team of 2-3 developers, in my time at Photocrowd I have delivered a stream of new site features and project refinements in a truly full stack role. I have managed projects: planning, tasking, and coding entire new sections of the site, taking features from concept to shipped and tested product.

On the front end I have realised page designs in a pixel-perfect fashion, building smooth responsive behaviour and interactivity in close consultation with the design team. Using react I have built complex trees of interactive components, kept performant by an awareness of best practice development for the framework.

As a back end developer, I have touched on every part of the project. I have worked with the data model, creating and planning new models and refining the project’s existing highly complex data structures. I have created and improved API endpoints and template views, always taking care to write efficient database queries and structure context data appropriately.

As a member of a small team my work has benefited from my ability to work independently and hold myself to an extremely high standard, both in terms of realised product and code quality.

### WCRS - Developer
**(07/15 - 11/15)**

Front end development for a major American tech client, working on thousands of pages over 50+ territories. On my own initiative I developed a suite of photoshop scripts to automate and enhance their image asset preparation workflow, saving hundreds of hours of developer/designer time.

### Founders and Coders
**(01/2015 - 06/15)**

* 12-week highly selective coding bootcamp. Full-stack web development in Javascript and Node
* TDD/BDD best practices, pair programming and other Agile techniques
* Independent work on freelance projects for external clients, including a live video workout application, developed from scratch using webRTC.

### Opera Singer
**(2008 - 2015)**

Over the last 7 years I have worked with some of the UK's top Opera companies as a soloist and a chorus member.
I have performed in venues ranging from the Royal Opera House to a primary school assembly hall.

#### Key Skills:
* Excellent team-work skills: leading, following.
* Consistently delivering under high pressure
* Not being afraid to fail
* A life-time commitment to personal development
* Personal initiative, confidence and humility
